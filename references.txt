potential packaging solution: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/deploying-python-applications/
guizero, our gui library of choice: https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/start/

unpack to template:
basically just the unpack step by itself

pack to zip:
basically just zip up the template and prompt for a name

pseudo code for installation:

check all zip files for conflicting vcdiffs and give warning

extract zip files ontop of each other to .tmp

os.walk() all of the vcdiffs

get the relative path of each vcdiff, this will be arg 1 for patching

cut the `.tmp` off the relative path, cut off the `.vcdiff`, this will be arg 2

apply each in order, removing each patch sequentially
