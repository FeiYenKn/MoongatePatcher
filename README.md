# *HoneyPatcher!*

A mod tool for Sonic the Fighters.

Right now, it can:
- Back up your game files
- Restore your game files
- Extract your rom.psarc
- Install packages using vcdiff patches

TODO:
- finalize package specification
- write the packing function

### Installing Mono (MacOS/Linux/SteamOS)

- MacOS: Install [mono](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mono) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- Linux: Install mono with your distribution's package manager. If a package / package manager is unavailable, see below.
- Steam Deck / Atomic Linux Distributions: Install [mono](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mono) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). **OR** if it is available, install both HoneyFetch and mono inside of a [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/).
